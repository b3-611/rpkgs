acepack,acepack: ACE and AVAS for Selecting Multiple Regression Transformations,OK,"Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are provided.
  The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE), 
  is an algorithm to find the fixed point of maximal
  correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2
  using smoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985. ""Estimating Optimal Transformations
  for Multiple Regression and Correlation"". Journal of the American Statistical Association.
  80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>].
  Also included is the Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than ACE when
  correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. ""Estimating Transformations for Regression via Additivity
  and Variance Stabilization"". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 83:394-405.

  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program

bit,bit: A Class for Vectors of 1-Bit Booleans,OK,"True boolean datatype (no NAs), 
  coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; 
  fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics. 
  With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the 
  expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less 
  RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of 
  R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains 
  for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations 
  it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such 
  components are used more than once. 
  Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing 
  standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package 
  allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() 
  directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector 
  memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying 
  from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a 
  performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for 
  representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 
  'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index 
  classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).",1.1-14,R (≥ 2.9.2),NA,NA

 WARNING: do not use them as replacement for 32bit integers, integer64 are not
 supported for subscripting by R-core and they have different semantics when 
 combined with double, e.g. integer64 + double => integer64. 
 Class integer64 can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. 
 Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, 
 characters and factors as well as many elementwise and summary functions.
